    <h1 class="heading">Benefits of Learning Computer Coding</h1>
    <p>
      Keeping aside the fact that coding is an emerging lesson to learn, there
      are several other beneficial facts as well which will help the children in
      many ways.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Cognitive Skills Development:</h3>
    <p>
      With the learning of code writing, kids gradually get exposed to the
      problem-solving process that helps in their cognitive development. While
      learning to code, children break the complex problems into small parts and
      approach to those with a logical thinking mind.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Better Persistence:</h3>
    <p>
      Computer coding for kids teaches one of the most valuable life skills to
      the kid. That is the skill of persistence. While going through the code
      learning process, kids face many challenges, that makes them search for
      solutions to overcome those challenges. This practice builds persistency
      in the children.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Enhanced Creativity:</h3>
    <p>
      Language is a tool to express ourselves and coding is no exception.
      Computer coding for kids makes them inquisitive of making or developing
      something on their own. This desire if addressed properly can lead to
      various creations.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Itâ€™s Logical approach:</h3>
    <p>
      Programming or computer coding for kids is a very interesting and creative
      program. In kids coding classes, they learn to build complex things like
      video games, websites, Apps etc in a playful method.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Better Collaboration Skills:</h3>
    <p>
      When kids get enrolled in any kids coding classes, they meet and
      communicate with other kids as well. They learn and develop things
      together. Kids collaborate at every stage of the learning journey.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Improved Communication:</h3>
    <p>
      No matter what stage of life we are at, communication is one thing that is
      always needed. Clear communication skills or the ability to clearly
      communicate complex things can lead a person to a very successful life
      irrespective of the industry. By starting to learn coding at an early
      stage of life, kids actually start to simplify complex things. This makes
      the kid capable of simplifying complexity and communicating those in
      simple terms.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Better Future Career:</h3>
    <p>
      Knowledge of coding is always considered as an added advantage. In the
      future when the world will be even more dependent on technology, the
      coding lessons learnt at an early age could prove to be beneficial for the
      kid. This will be an advantage for the kid when going for college or job
      applications.
